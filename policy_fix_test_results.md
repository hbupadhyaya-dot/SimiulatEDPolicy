# Policy Fix Test Results

## Issue Still Persists
After implementing the coefficient lookup fix, the policy levers are still not updating the outcome metrics.

## Test Results
1. **Innovation Incentives Selected**: ✅ Policy shows as selected (1/5 selected)
2. **Intensity Slider**: ✅ Shows 50% intensity
3. **Outcome Metrics**: ❌ Still all showing 50.0 with +0.0 change

## Expected vs Actual
**Expected for Innovation Incentives (50% intensity):**
- AI Literacy: 52.0 (+2.0) - coefficient "innov_incent_to_lit": 4.0
- Innovation Index: 52.0 (+2.0) - coefficient "innov_incent_to_innov": 4.0
- etc.

**Actual:**
- All metrics remain at 50.0 with +0.0 change

## Possible Additional Issues
1. **Console logging**: Need to check browser console for errors
2. **Coefficient values**: May need to verify the coefficient values are being found
3. **State updates**: React state might not be triggering re-renders
4. **Function calls**: The App component might not be calling the right functions

## Next Steps
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Add debug logging to see what's happening in the calculation
3. Verify the coefficient lookup is working correctly
4. Check if React state is updating properly
