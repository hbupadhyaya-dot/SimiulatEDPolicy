# Modal Still Broken Analysis

## Current Issue
After fixing the policy ID mappings, the "Why These Impacts" modal is still not displaying properly. When clicked, it appears to cause the page to go blank or crash.

## What We Fixed
- Updated all policy IDs in the policyDetails object to match the actual policy IDs used in the app:
  - `PROF_DEV` → `PD_FUNDS`
  - `STUDENT_PROTECTION` → `PROTECT_STD`
  - `TEACHER_AUTONOMY` → `EDU_AUTONOMY`
  - `COMMUNITY_INPUT` → `COMM_INPUT`
  - `EXTERNAL_FUNDING` → `DATA_GOV`
  - `CAREER_PATHWAYS` → `CAREER_PATH`
  - `DIGITAL_CITIZENSHIP` → `DIG_CITIZEN`
  - `ACCESSIBILITY` → `ADAPT_ASSESS`
  - Added missing policies: `INFRA_INVEST`, `SANDBOXES`, `INTEROP_STD`, `MODEL_EVAL`, `AI_CURRIC`, `IMPACT_REP_STD`

## Remaining Issues
The modal is still not working, which suggests there may be:
1. A JavaScript error in the generatePersonalizedInsights function
2. An issue with the policies array lookup
3. A problem with the modal rendering logic
4. Missing imports or dependencies

## Next Steps
Need to add error handling and debugging to identify the exact cause of the failure.
