# Blank Screen Issue Investigation

## Issue Reproduced
✅ **Confirmed**: The screen goes blank after selecting just 2 policies, not even 3!

## Test Results
1. **First Policy (Innovation Incentives)**: ✅ Works fine, shows intensity slider
2. **Second Policy (Student Protection)**: ❌ **SCREEN GOES BLANK** immediately after clicking

## Observations
- The issue occurs with just 2 policies, not 3 as initially reported
- The screen becomes completely white/blank except for the "Made with Manus" footer
- This suggests a JavaScript error or React rendering crash
- Likely a performance issue with calculations or infinite re-rendering

## Possible Causes
1. **Infinite re-rendering loop**: Multiple policy calculations triggering endless updates
2. **JavaScript error**: Calculation functions throwing errors with multiple policies
3. **Memory leak**: Complex calculations consuming too much memory
4. **State management issue**: React state updates causing rendering conflicts
5. **Synergy/tension calculations**: Complex interactions between policies causing crashes

## Next Steps
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Examine the calculation functions for performance issues
3. Look for infinite loops in React state updates
4. Optimize the synergy/tension calculation logic
5. Add error boundaries and performance optimizations
