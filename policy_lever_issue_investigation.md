# Policy Lever Issue Investigation

## Problem Identified
After implementing shock scenarios, the outcome metrics are no longer updating when policy levers are manipulated. 

## Test Results
1. **Innovation Incentives Policy Selected**: ✅ Policy lever shows as selected (1/5 selected)
2. **Intensity Slider**: ✅ Appears and shows 50% intensity
3. **Outcome Metrics**: ❌ All metrics remain at 50.0 with +0.0 change
4. **Expected Behavior**: Should show increases like +2 AI Literacy, +3 Innovation Index, etc.

## Likely Causes
The shock scenario implementation may have broken the policy calculation logic:

1. **Scenario baseline integration**: The new scenario-aware calculation functions might not be properly calling the original policy impact calculations
2. **State management**: The scenario state might be interfering with policy state updates
3. **Calculation order**: Policy effects might be calculated before scenario baselines are applied
4. **Function dependencies**: The updated functions might have broken dependencies between policy selection and metric calculation

## Next Steps
1. Examine the calculation functions in policyData.js
2. Check the App.jsx state management for policy updates
3. Verify the integration between scenario and policy calculations
4. Test the calculation flow step by step
