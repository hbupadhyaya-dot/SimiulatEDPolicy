# Time Series Curve Testing Results

## Testing Summary
Successfully tested the new realistic time series curves in the AI Policy Simulator with Innovation Incentives policy selected (50% intensity).

## Observed Behavior
The time series charts are now displaying with the new curve logic, but there appears to be an issue with the curve visualization. All metrics are showing relatively flat progression rather than the distinctive curve shapes that were implemented.

## Possible Issues Identified

### 1. Curve Function Logic
The curve functions may need adjustment in their mathematical formulation to create more pronounced visual differences.

### 2. Progress Factor Bounds
The progress factor bounds (0-1) might be constraining the curves too much, preventing the distinctive shapes from appearing.

### 3. Target Delta Calculation
The total delta between baseline and target values might be too small to show dramatic curve differences.

## Metrics Tested
- **AI Literacy**: Should show classic learning curve (slow start, rapid acceleration, plateau)
- **Innovation Index**: Should show rocket ship launch (dramatic early rise, then plateau)  
- **Teacher Satisfaction**: Should show initial dip, then recovery and growth

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ New curve functions implemented
- ‚úÖ Application deployed and functional
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Curve shapes not visually distinct as expected
- üîÑ May need curve function adjustments for more pronounced differences

## Next Steps
Consider adjusting the curve function parameters to create more dramatic visual differences between metrics, or investigate if the issue is with the data calculation or chart rendering.
