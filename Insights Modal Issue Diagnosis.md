# Insights Modal Issue Diagnosis

## Problem Identified
The "Why These Impacts" button is not displaying the modal content properly when policies are selected. The modal appears to open but shows a blank screen.

## Test Results

### Test 1: No Policies Selected
✅ **Working**: Modal displays correctly with the no-policy content:
- Header: "Why Your Policy Choices Create These Outcomes"
- Three paragraphs explaining reactive mode, lack of systematic approach, and competitive risks
- Specific budget recommendations ($350K for Innovation Incentives, $580K for Professional Development)

### Test 2: Innovation Incentives Selected
❌ **Not Working**: Modal opens but shows blank content
- Policy is properly selected (checkbox checked, intensity slider visible)
- Metrics are updating correctly (AI Literacy: 52.0, Innovation Index: 53.0, etc.)
- Modal opens but content is not visible

## Likely Causes
1. **JavaScript Error**: The generateSpecificPolicyInsights function may have an error when processing selected policies
2. **Data Structure Mismatch**: The policy IDs or metric keys may not match between the UI and the insights function
3. **Modal Rendering Issue**: The modal may not be properly rendering the dynamic content

## Current Function Analysis
The generatePersonalizedInsights function in policyData.js appears to be quite detailed with:
- Specific cost information for each policy
- Detailed mechanisms and impacts
- Risk assessments
- Strategic recommendations

However, there seems to be a disconnect between the function and the UI when policies are selected.

## Next Steps
1. Check for JavaScript errors in the browser console
2. Verify the data structure being passed to the insights function
3. Test the function with sample data to ensure it's working correctly
4. Fix any data mapping issues between UI and function
