# Policy ID Mismatch Analysis

## Root Cause Identified!

The issue is a **policy ID mismatch** between the app's policy definitions and the policyDetails object in the insights function.

### App Policy IDs (from policy definitions):
- `INNOV_INCENT` (Innovation Incentives)
- `PROTECT_STD` (Student Protection) 
- `PD_FUNDS` (Professional Development)
- `EDU_AUTONOMY` (Teacher Autonomy)
- `CAREER_PATH` (Career Pathways)
- `DIG_CITIZEN` (Digital Citizenship)
- `COMM_INPUT` (Community Input)
- `IMPACT_REP_STD` (Impact Reporting)
- `AI_CURRIC` (Job Alignment)
- `ADAPT_ASSESS` (Accessibility)
- `INFRA_INVEST` (Infrastructure)
- `INTEROP_STD` (Interoperability)
- `SANDBOXES` (Innovation Sandbox)
- `MODEL_EVAL` (Model Evaluation)
- `DATA_GOV` (External Funding)

### Insights Function Policy IDs (from policyDetails):
- `INNOV_INCENT` ✅ (matches)
- `PROF_DEV` ❌ (should be `PD_FUNDS`)
- `STUDENT_PROTECTION` ❌ (should be `PROTECT_STD`)
- `TEACHER_AUTONOMY` ❌ (should be `EDU_AUTONOMY`)
- `COMMUNITY_INPUT` ❌ (should be `COMM_INPUT`)
- `EXTERNAL_FUNDING` ❌ (should be `DATA_GOV`)
- `CAREER_PATHWAYS` ❌ (should be `CAREER_PATH`)
- `DIGITAL_CITIZENSHIP` ❌ (should be `DIG_CITIZEN`)
- `ACCESSIBILITY` ❌ (should be `ADAPT_ASSESS`)

### The Problem
When a user selects policies, the app passes policy IDs like `PD_FUNDS`, but the insights function looks for `PROF_DEV` in the policyDetails object. Since it can't find the details, the function likely fails or returns undefined content.

### Solution
Update the policyDetails object keys to match the actual policy IDs used in the app.
