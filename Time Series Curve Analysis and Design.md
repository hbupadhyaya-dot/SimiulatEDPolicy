# Time Series Curve Analysis and Design

## Curve Shape Descriptions Summary

### 1. AI Literacy - Classic Learning Curve
- **Pattern**: Slow start → Rapid acceleration (years 2-3) → Levels off
- **Mathematical Model**: S-curve (sigmoid) with delayed start
- **Key Points**: Flat beginning, steep middle, plateau at practical ceiling

### 2. Community Trust - Earned Through Results
- **Pattern**: Extremely flat start (2-3 years) → Steady upward climb
- **Mathematical Model**: Delayed linear growth with slow start
- **Key Points**: Trust must be earned, never reaches 100% (healthy skepticism)

### 3. Innovation Index - Rocket Ship Launch
- **Pattern**: Dramatic early rise → Peak at years 3-4 → Gradual plateau
- **Mathematical Model**: Exponential rise followed by decay to plateau
- **Key Points**: Quick wins early, then optimization phase

### 4. Teacher Satisfaction - Recovery Pattern
- **Pattern**: Initial dip below baseline → Recovery → Steady growth
- **Mathematical Model**: U-shaped recovery then linear growth
- **Key Points**: Change fatigue initially, then benefits realized

### 5. Digital Equity Score - Step-wise Improvements
- **Pattern**: Distinct jumps in phases (access → capability → outcomes)
- **Mathematical Model**: Step function with plateaus between phases
- **Key Points**: Progress in discrete phases, not smooth

### 6. Budget Strain - Investment Spike
- **Pattern**: Immediate spike → High plateau → Gradual decline
- **Mathematical Model**: Initial jump, then exponential decay to new baseline
- **Key Points**: Never returns to original baseline

### 7. Employability - Delayed Response
- **Pattern**: Flat for 3-4 years → Sudden upward movement
- **Mathematical Model**: Delayed step function with late activation
- **Key Points**: Employers need proof before changing practices

### 8. AI Vulnerability - Complex Security Pattern
- **Pattern**: High start → Improvement → Brief spike (years 5-6) → Continued improvement
- **Mathematical Model**: Declining trend with mid-term bump
- **Key Points**: Overconfidence creates temporary vulnerability increase

## Implementation Strategy

Each metric needs a custom curve function that:
1. Respects the baseline values from scenarios
2. Applies policy effects over the described timeline
3. Creates realistic, visually distinct progression patterns
4. Maintains logical bounds (0-100 range, never reaching extremes)

## Mathematical Functions to Implement

1. **Sigmoid with delay** for AI Literacy
2. **Delayed linear** for Community Trust  
3. **Exponential rise-decay** for Innovation Index
4. **U-curve recovery** for Teacher Satisfaction
5. **Step function** for Digital Equity Score
6. **Spike-decay** for Budget Strain
7. **Delayed activation** for Employability
8. **Decline with bump** for AI Vulnerability
